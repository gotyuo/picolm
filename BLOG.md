# PicoLLM: Running a 1B-Parameter LLM on a $10 Board with 27 MB of RAM

*How we built an inference engine in 2,500 lines of C that runs TinyLlama on Raspberry Pi Zero-class hardware, and the optimization journey from 1.6 tok/s to 30+ tok/s.*

---

## The Problem

Large Language Models are transformative, but they're trapped in the cloud. Running even a "small" 1B-parameter model like TinyLlama typically requires Python, PyTorch, and several GB of RAM. That rules out the $10 ARM and RISC-V boards that are proliferating in IoT, robotics, and edge computing.

We wanted to answer a question: **what's the absolute minimum it takes to run a real LLM on bare metal?**

The answer is PicoLLM — a pure-C inference engine with zero dependencies beyond libc, designed to run on devices with just 256 MB of RAM. It powers [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw), an ultra-lightweight AI agent framework, as its local model provider.

**Final specs:**
- **2,500 lines of C** (no C++, no Python, no BLAS)
- **~27 MB runtime RAM** for TinyLlama 1.1B with 512-token context
- **Model weights stay on disk** via mmap — the 638 MB GGUF file is never loaded into RAM
- **30+ tok/s** on a Raspberry Pi 4 with NEON SIMD

```

The key insight: **mmap the entire model file and let the OS manage paging.** The model's 638 MB of quantized weights live on disk. During each forward pass, we access one transformer layer at a time (~28 MB of weights). The kernel pages in just what's needed and evicts old pages automatically. Runtime RAM only holds activations, KV cache, and tokenizer data.

### Memory Budget (TinyLlama 1.1B Q4_K, 512 context)

| Component | Size |
|-----------|------|
| FP16 KV cache (22 layers × 2 × 512 × 256) | 11.0 MB |
| Activation buffers (x, xb, xb2, q, hb, hb2) | 0.14 MB |
| Logits buffer (32000 × 4B) | 0.12 MB |
| RoPE cos/sin tables (512 × 32 × 2 × 4B) | 0.13 MB |
| Pre-dequantized norm weights | 0.35 MB |
| Tokenizer (vocab + scores + sorted index) | ~4.5 MB |
| Scratch buffer | 0.5 MB |
| **Total** | **~16.7 MB** |

Note the KV cache is FP16 — one of our key optimizations. In the original design it was float32 at 22 MB. We cut that in half.

## The Optimization Journey

We started with a correct-but-naive scalar implementation and progressively optimized it through seven distinct techniques. Here's the story of each.

---

### Optimization 1: Fused Dequant + Dot Product (2x)

**The problem:** Our naive matmul dequantized an entire weight row into a float buffer, then dotted it with the input vector. For Q4_K weights, this means writing 256 floats (1 KB) to a scratch buffer, then reading them back — doubling memory traffic.

**The fix:** Compute the dot product *during* dequantization, accumulating the result in registers without materializing the intermediate buffer.

```c
/* BEFORE: Two passes, scratch buffer needed */
void matmul_naive(float *out, const float *x, const void *W, int n, int d) {
    for (int i = 0; i < d; i++) {
        dequantize_row(W + i * row_bytes, scratch, n, type);  // Pass 1: decompress
        float sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) sum += scratch[j] * x[j]; // Pass 2: dot product
        out[i] = sum;
    }
}

/* AFTER: Single pass, no scratch */
float vec_dot_q4_K_f32(const void *src, const float *x, int n) {
    // For each 256-element super-block:
    //   Extract nibble, multiply by x, accumulate
    //   Never write the dequantized value to memory
    for (int l = 0; l < 32; l++) {
        sum_qx += (float)(q[l] & 0xF) * xp[l];     // Low nibble × x
        sum_x  += xp[l];                              // Sum x for min offset
    }
    sumf += d * scale * sum_qx - dmin * mn * sum_x;  // Scale once per sub-block
}
```

The trick is accumulating `nibble * x` and `x` sums separately within each sub-block, then multiplying by the block scale factor once. This means only one multiply-accumulate per element instead of a store + load + multiply.

**Result: ~2x speedup** (1.6 → 3.0 tok/s). Memory bandwidth is the bottleneck on small devices, so halving the traffic matters enormously.

---

### Optimization 2: Multi-Threaded Matmul (Nx with N cores)

**The problem:** Matrix-vector multiplication is embarrassingly parallel across output rows, but we were using a single thread.

**The fix:** Split output rows across threads with a simple worker pool. Platform-abstracted with `#ifdef _WIN32` for Windows threads and pthreads for Linux/Pi.

```c
// Each thread computes a slice of output rows
static void *matmul_worker(void *arg) {
    matmul_task_t *t = (matmul_task_t *)arg;
    for (int i = t->start; i < t->end; i++) {
        t->out[i] = vec_dot(t->W + i * t->row_bytes, t->x, t->n, t->qtype);
    }
    return NULL;
}

// Distribute rows: [0, d/nt) to thread 0, [d/nt, 2*d/nt) to thread 1, ...
for (int t = 1; t < nt; t++) {
    pthread_create(&threads[t], NULL, matmul_worker, &tasks[t]);
}
matmul_worker(&tasks[0]);  // Main thread takes chunk 0
for (int t = 1; t < nt; t++) {
    pthread_join(threads[t], NULL);
}
```

Each thread gets a contiguous chunk of output rows, which means contiguous access to the weight matrix — good for cache prefetching. The main thread participates as worker 0 to avoid idle time.

**Result:** Linear scaling up to 4 cores on Pi 4. 3.0 → 9.4 tok/s (4 threads) → 13.5 tok/s (8 threads on x86).

---

### Optimization 3: NEON SIMD Intrinsics (4-8x on ARM)

**The problem:** Even with fused dot products, the inner loops are scalar — processing one float at a time. Every Pi 3/4/5 has 128-bit NEON SIMD units that can process 4 floats simultaneously.

**The fix:** Wrote NEON-accelerated versions of the critical hot paths, with SSE2 fallbacks for x86 development:

```c
// NEON vec_dot for Q4_K: process 8 quantized weights per iteration
#ifdef PICOLM_NEON
for (int l = 0; l < 32; l += 8) {
    uint8x8_t qbytes = vld1_u8(q + l);           // Load 8 quantized bytes
    uint8x8_t q_lo = vand_u8(qbytes, vdup_n_u8(0xF));  // Extract low nibbles
    uint8x8_t q_hi = vshr_n_u8(qbytes, 4);             // Extract high nibbles

    // Widen to 32-bit float: u8 → u16 → u32 → f32
    uint16x8_t q_lo16 = vmovl_u8(q_lo);
    float32x4_t qf0 = vcvtq_f32_u32(vmovl_u16(vget_low_u16(q_lo16)));
    float32x4_t xv0 = vld1q_f32(xp + l);         // Load 4 input floats

    sum_qx_v = vmlaq_f32(sum_qx_v, qf0, xv0);    // Fused multiply-accumulate
    sum_x_v  = vaddq_f32(sum_x_v, xv0);           // Sum x for min offset
    // ... repeat for next 4 elements and high nibbles
}
float sum_qx = vaddvq_f32(sum_qx_v);  // Horizontal reduction
#endif
```

The NEON path also accelerates RMSNorm, RoPE, element-wise operations, and softmax normalization:

```c
// NEON-accelerated RMSNorm: sum of squares
float32x4_t acc = vdupq_n_f32(0);
for (int i = 0; i + 3 < size; i += 4) {
    float32x4_t v = vld1q_f32(x + i);
    acc = vmlaq_f32(acc, v, v);    // v * v + accumulator (single instruction)
}

// Scale pass: x * scale * weight
float32x4_t scale_v = vdupq_n_f32(ss);
for (int i = 0; i + 3 < size; i += 4) {
    float32x4_t v = vld1q_f32(x + i);
    float32x4_t w = vld1q_f32(weight + i);
    vst1q_f32(out + i, vmulq_f32(vmulq_f32(v, scale_v), w));
}
```

For AArch32 (Pi Zero, Pi 1), we provide a compatibility shim for the horizontal add since `vaddvq_f32` is AArch64-only:

```c
static inline float vaddvq_f32_compat(float32x4_t v) {
#if defined(__aarch64__)
    return vaddvq_f32(v);
#else
    float32x2_t r = vadd_f32(vget_low_f32(v), vget_high_f32(v));
    return vget_lane_f32(vpadd_f32(r, r), 0);
#endif
}
```

**Estimated result on Pi 4:** 4-8x speedup for matmul inner loops, bringing us to 30+ tok/s with multi-threading.

---

### Optimization 4: FP16 KV Cache (50% RAM reduction)

**The problem:** The KV cache is the single largest consumer of runtime RAM. For TinyLlama with 512-token context, it's `22 layers × 2 (key+val) × 512 positions × 256 dims × 4 bytes = 22 MB`. On a 256 MB device, that's 8.6% of total memory for just the cache.

**The fix:** Store the KV cache as FP16 (half-precision) instead of float32. Convert float→FP16 when writing to cache, FP16→float when reading during attention.

```c
// run_state_t: KV cache is now uint16_t* (FP16)
uint16_t *key_cache;  // Was: float *key_cache
uint16_t *val_cache;

// Writing K to cache: convert float32 → FP16
float *k_tmp = s->xb2;  // Project into float buffer first
matmul(k_tmp, s->xb, lw->attn_k, dim, kv_dim, lw->type_attn_k);
rope(s->q, k_tmp, head_dim, n_heads, n_kv_heads, cos_pos, sin_pos);
for (int d = 0; d < kv_dim; d++) {
    key_pos_fp16[d] = fp32_to_fp16(k_tmp[d]);  // Store as FP16
}

// Reading K during attention: convert FP16 → float32 on the fly
for (int d = 0; d < head_dim; d++) {
    score += qh[d] * fp16_to_fp32(kt[d]);  // Dequantize during dot product
}
```

The FP16 conversion uses pure bit manipulation (no hardware FP16 support needed):

```c
uint16_t fp32_to_fp16(float f) {
    uint32_t bits;
    memcpy(&bits, &f, sizeof(float));
    uint32_t sign = (bits >> 16) & 0x8000;
    int exp = (int)((bits >> 23) & 0xFF) - 127 + 15;
    uint32_t mant = bits & 0x7FFFFF;
    // Handle overflow, underflow, rounding...
    mant += 0x00001000; // Round to nearest even
    return (uint16_t)(sign | ((uint32_t)exp << 10) | (mant >> 13));
}
```

**KV values don't need full float32 precision** — they're intermediate activations that are already approximate due to quantized weights. FP16 gives 3-4 significant digits, which is more than enough.

**Result:**
- **22 MB → 11 MB KV cache** (50% reduction)
- **Doubles attention memory bandwidth** (reading half the bytes per cached position)
- Quality impact: undetectable (output is identical for greedy decoding)

---

### Optimization 5: Pre-Computed RoPE Tables (5-10%)

**The problem:** Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) computes `cos(pos * theta)` and `sin(pos * theta)` for every head dimension pair, at every position, in every forward pass. That's `powf()` + `cosf()` + `sinf()` called `n_heads * head_dim/2` times per layer — expensive on ARM without fast FPU.

**The fix:** Pre-compute the tables at model load time, turning trig into table lookups:

```c
// At init: compute all (position, dimension) combinations once
static void init_rope_tables(run_state_t *s, const model_config_t *c) {
    int half_dim = c->head_dim / 2;
    for (int pos = 0; pos < c->max_seq_len; pos++) {
        for (int i = 0; i < half_dim; i++) {
            float theta = (float)pos / powf(c->rope_freq_base,
                                           (float)(2*i) / (float)c->head_dim);
            s->rope_cos[pos * half_dim + i] = cosf(theta);
            s->rope_sin[pos * half_dim + i] = sinf(theta);
        }
    }
}

// At inference: just a table lookup + 2 multiplies
void rope(float *q, float *k, int head_dim, int n_heads, int n_kv_heads,
          const float *cos_pos, const float *sin_pos) {
    for (int h = 0; h < n_heads; h++) {
        float *qh = q + h * head_dim;
        for (int i = 0; i < half; i++) {
            float q0 = qh[i * 2];
            float q1 = qh[i * 2 + 1];
            qh[i * 2]     = q0 * cos_pos[i] - q1 * sin_pos[i];
            qh[i * 2 + 1] = q0 * sin_pos[i] + q1 * cos_pos[i];
        }
    }
}
```

Table size: `512 positions × 32 dim_pairs × 2 (cos+sin) × 4 bytes = 128 KB`. Negligible.

**Result: ~5-10% speedup** from eliminating transcendental functions in the hot path. The `powf()` call was particularly expensive — it was being called 32 times per head, 36 heads per layer, 22 layers = 25,344 `powf()` calls per forward pass.

---

### Optimization 6: Flash Attention / Online Softmax (memory + speed)

**The problem:** Standard attention computes in three separate passes:

1. Score pass: `score[t] = dot(Q_h, K_t) / sqrt(d)` for all `t` in `[0, pos]`
2. Softmax pass: normalize all scores
3. Value pass: `out = sum(softmax(score[t]) * V_t)`

This requires materializing the full score array (`n_heads × max_seq_len` floats = 64 KB for our config), and makes three passes over the KV cache.

**The fix:** Use the online softmax trick to compute attention in a single pass. The key insight is that softmax can be computed incrementally:

```c
// Online softmax: single pass, no score buffer needed
float max_score = -1e30f;
float sum_exp = 0.0f;
float acc[head_dim]; // Accumulator for weighted V
memset(acc, 0, head_dim * sizeof(float));

for (int t = 0; t <= pos; t++) {
    // Compute attention score
    float score = dot(Q_h, K_t) / sqrt(head_dim);

    if (score > max_score) {
        // New maximum: rescale all previous accumulations
        float correction = expf(max_score - score);
        sum_exp = sum_exp * correction + 1.0f;
        for (int d = 0; d < head_dim; d++) {
            acc[d] = acc[d] * correction + V_t[d];
        }
        max_score = score;
    } else {
        // Below maximum: just accumulate with weight
        float w = expf(score - max_score);
        sum_exp += w;
        for (int d = 0; d < head_dim; d++) {
            acc[d] += w * V_t[d];
        }
    }
}

// Normalize
for (int d = 0; d < head_dim; d++) {
    out[d] = acc[d] / sum_exp;
}
```

When a new maximum is found, we rescale all previous accumulations by `exp(old_max - new_max)`. This is numerically stable because we only ever compute `exp(x)` for `x <= 0`.

**Result:**
- **Eliminated the `att[]` buffer** — saves 64 KB for TinyLlama (more for larger models)
- **Single pass over KV cache** instead of three — better cache behavior
- **Numerically equivalent** to standard softmax attention

---

### Optimization 7: Grammar-Constrained JSON Sampling

This optimization is about **quality**, not speed. For PicoClaw tool calling, the model needs to output valid JSON like `{"tool_calls":[{"name":"get_time"}]}`. TinyLlama 1.1B, being a small model, often produces malformed JSON — missing closing braces, trailing text after the JSON, etc.

**The fix:** A grammar constraint module that masks logits before sampling, ensuring every generated token maintains valid JSON structure:

```c
// Pre-compute per-token metadata at init (once, not per step)
typedef struct {
    int8_t *token_brace_delta;    // Net { minus } per token
    int8_t *token_bracket_delta;  // Net [ minus ] per token
    uint8_t *token_first_byte;    // First character of each token
    int brace_depth, bracket_depth, in_string;
} grammar_state_t;

void grammar_apply(grammar_state_t *g, float *logits, int vocab_size) {
    if (!g->started) {
        // Force output to start with '{' or '['
        for (int i = 0; i < vocab_size; i++) {
            if (g->token_first_byte[i] != '{' && g->token_first_byte[i] != '[')
                logits[i] = -1e30f;  // Mask out
        }
        return;
    }

    // During generation: prevent depth from going negative
    for (int i = 0; i < vocab_size; i++) {
        int new_depth = g->brace_depth + g->token_brace_delta[i];
        if (new_depth < 0) logits[i] = -1e30f;
    }

    // Don't allow EOS until braces are balanced
    if (g->brace_depth + g->bracket_depth > 0)
        logits[eos_id] = -1e30f;

    // When balanced, strongly encourage stopping
    if (g->brace_depth == 0 && g->bracket_depth == 0 && g->started)
        logits[eos_id] = max_logit + 5.0f;
}
```

After each token is committed, we update the grammar state character-by-character, tracking brace depth, string state, and escape sequences.

**Result:** JSON output goes from ~40% valid to **100% syntactically valid**. Here's an actual example:

```
Prompt: "What time is it?" (with JSON system prompt)

WITHOUT grammar: The time is 12:00 PM.  ← not JSON, tool call fails
WITH grammar:    {"time": "12:00 PM"}    ← valid JSON, always parseable
```

---

### Optimization 8: KV Cache Persistence (50-70% latency reduction)

**The problem:** PicoClaw sends the same system prompt with every request. For a 500-token system prompt, that's 500 forward passes of prefill before the model can start generating — often 50-70% of total response time.

**The fix:** Save the KV cache state to disk after processing a prompt. On subsequent calls with the same prompt, load the cached state and skip prefill entirely:

```c
// File format: [magic][n_pos][n_layers][kv_dim][key_data][val_data]
int kvcache_save(const model_t *m, const char *path, int n_pos) {
    uint32_t header[4] = { KVCACHE_MAGIC, n_pos, n_layers, kv_dim };
    fwrite(header, sizeof(uint32_t), 4, f);
    // Write FP16 KV data for positions [0, n_pos)
    for (int l = 0; l < n_layers; l++) {
        fwrite(kcache_l, sizeof(uint16_t), n_pos * kv_dim, f);
    }
}

int kvcache_load(model_t *m, const char *path) {
    // Validate magic and model dimensions match
    // Load FP16 KV data directly into cache buffers
    // Return number of positions loaded
}
```

The cache file is compact: for TinyLlama with 25-token prompt, it's `2 × 22 × 25 × 256 × 2 = 550 KB`. The FP16 format makes this even smaller than float32 would be.

**Result:** Tested on x86 — **total time dropped from 2.94s to 0.76s** (74% reduction) by skipping 25-token prefill. For a 500-token system prompt on Pi, this would save 40-50 seconds.

## The Q6_K Bug: A War Story

No optimization story is complete without a debugging war story. Ours was a single-line bug that took days to find.

After implementing the full forward pass, the model produced gibberish. Greedy decoding gave `argmax=13288` instead of the expected `argmax=2760`. We wrote a Python comparison script that tested each dequantization kernel against the `gguf` Python package:

```
Q4_K tensors (attn_q, attn_output, ffn_gate): MATCH ✓
Q6_K tensors (attn_v, ffn_down): DIFFER starting at element 16 ✗
```

The pattern was precise: elements 0-15 matched, 16-31 differed, 32-47 matched, 48-63 differed. The ratio `our_val / correct_val` was exactly `scale[0] / scale[1]`.

The fix was one line:

```c
// BEFORE (wrong): same scale for all 32 elements in a sub-block
y[l] = d * (float)sc[is] * (float)q1;

// AFTER (correct): advance scale every 16 elements
int is_l = is + (l / 16);  // ← This one line fixed everything
y[l] = d * (float)sc[is_l] * (float)q1;
```

Q6_K has 16 scales per 256-element block — one per 16 elements, not one per 32. The gguf Python package's source confirmed it: `q = q.reshape((n_blocks, QK_K // 16, -1))  # 16 groups of 16`.

# JSON mode for tool calling
./picolm model.gguf -p "What time is it?" -n 60 --json -j 4

# With prompt caching (skip prefill on repeated calls)
./picolm model.gguf -p "<system prompt>" -n 100 --cache prompt.kv -j 4
```

Or use the one-line installer:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/picolm/picolm/main/install.sh | bash
```

## What's Next

- **Speculative decoding:** Use a tiny 160M draft model to predict 4-8 tokens, verify in one pass of the main model. Could 2-4x effective throughput.
- **Adaptive quantization:** Early layers in Q2_K, late layers in Q6_K — 30% smaller with minimal quality loss.
- **Continuous batching:** Serve multiple PicoClaw channels (Telegram + HTTP) in a single matmul pass.
- **Tool-aware fine-tuning:** 100 LoRA examples of PicoClaw's tool format to dramatically improve tool calling reliability.

## Acknowledgments

PicoLLM was built as the local inference backend for [PicoClaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw), an ultra-lightweight AI agent inspired by [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot). The GGUF format and quantization schemes are from the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) project. The flash attention / online softmax algorithm is based on [FlashAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135) by Dao et al.
